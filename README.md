# Very bad programming language (Unnamed)

## Rational

Lets say you are stuck with a computer, and a keyboard, and to save your life you MUST write a program that does something. However, to your surprise the keyboard is actually a typewriter from the 1900s, which can only write the following characters:

- A~Z
- a~z
- 0~9

worry do not! for *very bad programming language* is to your rescue!

## Usage

As you can see, this "language" is actually just a bunch of C Macros, and as such all of the logic in this language is equivalent to that of C's. There are, however, a few "additions" in order to make alphanumeric programming possible.

As a reference, all language commands begin with a Capital Letter, for example: `Do`, `While`, `Arguments`, `Endarguments`, etc.
